# Method overriding is an example of run time polymorphism. In this, the specific implementation of the
# method that is already provided by the parent class is provided by the child class.
# It is used to change the behavior of existing methods and there is a need for at least two classes for method overriding.
# In method overriding, inheritance always required as it is done between parent class(superclass) and child class(child class) methods


class A:

    def fun1(self):
        print('feature_1 of class A')

    def fun2(self):
        print('feature_2 of class A')


class B(A):

    # Modified function that is
    # already exist in class A
    def fun1(self):
        print('Modified feature_1 of class A by class B')

    def fun3(self):
        print('feature_3 of class B')


# Create instance
obj = B()

# Call the override function
obj.fun1()
